                Healthcare IT services are essential for keeping your medical
                practice running smoothly. From maintaining accurate patient
                records to providing secure access to your data, your technology
                enables you to provide quality care for your patients. Cyber
                attacks targeting healthcare organizations make data security a
                critical aspect of medical practices today, and HIPAA compliance
                sets strict guidelines for storing and security PHI. Healthcare
                IT services from Galaxy IT can provide security to protect your
                practiceâ€™s critical data while also keeping day-to-day IT
                operations running flawlessly. With a secure network
                infrastructure, you can be confident knowing that protected
                health information is safe from unauthorized access.
